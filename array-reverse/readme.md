# Reverse an Array

*Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.*

What do I return?
- The same array?
- A new array?

What are the inputs and outputs?

Sample data:

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] should give [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

[89, 2354, 3546, 23, 10, -923, 823, -12] should give [-12, 823, -923, 10, 23, 3546, 2354, 89]

Any methods should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the challenge.
