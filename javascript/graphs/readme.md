# Graphs

Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list.

## Approach & Efficiency
Time: Most methods are O(1)
Space: Should only take as much space as there are nodes.

## API
`add node`
Arguments: value
Returns: The added node
Add a node to the graph

`add edge`
Arguments: 2 nodes to be connected by the edge, weight (optional)
Returns: nothing
Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
If specified, assign a weight to the edge
Both nodes should already be in the Graph

`get nodes`
Arguments: none
Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)

`get neighbors`
Arguments: node
Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node
Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection

`size`
Arguments: none
Returns the total number of nodes in the graph

`breadth first`
Arguments: Node
Return: A collection of nodes in the order they were visited.
Display the collection

## Structure and Testing

Node can be successfully added to the graph
An edge can be successfully added to the graph
A collection of all nodes can be properly retrieved from the graph
All appropriate neighbors can be retrieved from the graph
Neighbors are returned with the weight between nodes included
The proper size is returned, representing the number of nodes in the graph
A graph with only one node and edge can be properly returned
An empty graph properly returns null
